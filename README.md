# ti.S3FileTransferManager

This Titanium module is an attempt to wrap the S3 file transfer portion of the AWS Mobile SDK. This has been
built primarily for an in-house project and as such is designed to meet our specific requirements.

Currently, it has the following limitations:

* iOS only (Android planned... maybe)
* Upload only
* Only unauthenticated and developer provider authentication are currently supported.

## Documentation
Documentation can be found in the documentation folder.

## Complete example
A complete example can be found in `iphone/example/app.js`.

## Disclaimer
I am not a native developer! Building this module was quite challenging for me and I expect the code is less than optimal. Pull Requests and / or advice are very welcome :)
